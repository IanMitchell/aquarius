Aquarius is a general purpose [Discord](https://discordapp.com/) chat bot. If you have questions, concerns, suggestions, or need general assistance, please create an issue, tweet [@IanMitchel1](https://twitter.com/ianmitchel1), or join [Aquarius's Discord Server](http://discord.companyinc.company/).

## Overview

Aquarius is designed to be easy and intuitive to use for both users and new contributors. The goal is to reach feature parity with the mega-bots with much less code complexity. It is fully customizeable, allowing guilds to enable or disable commands in order to make the bot fit their exact needs.

Aquarius is written in Node.js and interacts with many different APIs and Services. It is hosted on Digital Ocean and uses a PostgreSQL database.

## Community

Aquarius development happens on the [Sol Sanctum](http://discord.gg/ian) Discord Server - it's an active and diverse community that has far-ranging tastes. If you'd like to ask questions about Aquarius, learn more about programming, or have an idea for a new command come talk to us!
