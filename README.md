Aquarius is a general purpose [Discord](https://discordapp.com/) chat bot. If you have questions, concerns, suggestions, or need general assistance, please create an issue, tweet [@IanMitchel1](https://twitter.com/ianmitchel1), or join [Aquarius's Discord Server](http://discord.companyinc.company/).

## Usage

For help using Aquarius, visit https://aquarius.sh/docs.

## Development

For help with local development of the bot, check the [Getting Started Wiki Page](/wiki/Getting-Started).

#### Visual Studio Code

The repository is setup to work well with Visual Studio Code. You can add breakpoints and run the "Launch Aquarius" task to start the bot in "Debug" mode. Many of the core APIs also have JSDoc integrations for VS Code's intellisence.

You can definitely still use your editor of choice, but if you haven't used VS Code before it's worth giving it a shot!
